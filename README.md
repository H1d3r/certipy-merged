# certipy-merged

This repository contains a fork of [ly4k/Certipy](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy) with many open pull requests merged, made compatible with each other, and tested (to a certain degree).

As this is a _work in progress_, some features may or may not work as expected and things might break.

## Installation

### Using `pipx` (Recommended)

If you prefer the convenience of automagically managed virtual environments, use [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/zimedev/certipy-merged.git@main
```

If you need support for LDAP Channel Binding, you need to inject the patched `ldap3` library into the Python venv:

```bash
pipx inject --force certipy-ad git+https://github.com/ly4k/ldap3
```

### Using Python `pip` With a Virtual Environment

If you want to manually manage your installation, use Python's `pip` with `venv` to install in a directory of your choosing, such as `/opt`:

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/zimedev/certipy-merged
cd certipy-merged
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install .
```

### On Arch Linux

If you're on Arch Linux, you can add the [dadevel/archpkgs](https://github.com/dadevel/archpkgs) repository, which defaults to `certipy-merged` and includes LDAP Channel Binding support out of the box.
To add the `archpkgs` repo, refer to the official [setup instructions](https://github.com/dadevel/archpkgs?tab=readme-ov-file#setup).
Next, you can install `archpkgs/certipy`:

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy archpkgs/certipy
```

```bash
/opt/archpkgs/bin/certipy
